# Kohrus: The Stock Market for Music

## Executive Summary

Kohrus (formerly Chorus Capital) is a regulated digital platform that transforms song royalties into tradable financial assets, creating a new, transparent, and direct financial partnership between creators and their core supporters. We democratize the $200B+ Creator Economy by turning royalties into liquid assets, enabling artists to access non-dilutive capital while giving fans the opportunity to invest directly in music and earn passive income.

## The Problem: The Broken Value Chain

### Problem Statement 1: The Artist Funding Gap

Independent and emerging artists struggle to secure up-front capital for production, marketing, and touring without sacrificing significant creative control or future earnings to traditional labels. The majority of streaming revenue is concentrated, leaving 90%+ of artists underfunded despite having engaged fan bases.

**Key Issues:**
- Limited access to capital without giving up IP ownership
- High debt burden from traditional financing options
- Loss of creative control when working with major labels
- Opaque royalty distribution systems

### Problem Statement 2: Passive Fandom

Fans, the true economic drivers of a song's success, are treated purely as consumers. They invest time and emotion, yet they have no financial stake or ability to benefit directly when their supported artists succeed. This creates a disconnect between cultural success and financial participation.

**Key Issues:**
- Fans cannot participate financially in artist success
- No ownership or investment opportunities for music IP
- Limited ways to support artists beyond consumption
- Exclusion from the value created by their engagement

## The Solution: A Stock Market for Music

Kohrus provides liquidity, ownership, and alignment by creating a regulated digital platform that transforms song royalties into tradable financial assets.

### Core Value Proposition

**For Artists:**
- Access to immediate, non-dilutive capital by selling fractionalized shares of future royalties (typically 5-20% of a song's royalty stream)
- Retain 100% creative control and IP ownership
- Direct financial partnership with fans who become incentivized marketers
- Transparent, real-time royalty distribution

**For Fans/Investors:**
- Opportunity to invest directly in music as a stable, alternative asset class
- Earn passive income through streaming royalty dividends
- Trade shares on a liquid secondary market
- Low barrier to entry (starting from ₹50)
- Direct financial alignment with artist success

## How It Works: Fractionalized Royalties

### 1. Issuance
An artist sets a valuation for a song's future royalty stream and chooses what percentage (e.g., 5% to 20%) to sell. This valuation is based on historical streaming data, market trends, and projected performance.

### 2. Primary Offering (ISO - Initial Song Offering)
Fractionalized shares are sold to fans/investors on the Kohrus primary market, providing immediate working capital to the artist. The platform handles all regulatory compliance, KYC/AML checks, and payment processing.

### 3. Secondary Market & Payouts
- Shares are bought and sold peer-to-peer on a liquid exchange
- As the song earns streaming royalties, Kohrus collects the revenue from collection societies and DSPs
- Dividends are distributed pro-rata to all shareholders in real-time
- Share prices fluctuate based on song performance and market demand

### The Financial Alignment
When the artist succeeds (more streams), the fan-investors succeed (higher dividends and share value). The financial interests are perfectly aligned, creating a win-win ecosystem.

## The Financial Parallel: Music as the New REIT

Music royalties function similarly to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), offering:

| Characteristic | REIT | Music Royalty Investment (Kohrus) |
|----------------|------|-----------------------------------|
| Asset Class | Land/Buildings (Physical IP) | Song Catalogs (Intellectual Property) |
| Income Type | Rent payments from tenants | Royalty payments from streamers/DSPs |
| Cash Flow Frequency | Consistent, recurring (Monthly/Quarterly) | Consistent, recurring (Quarterly/Real-time) |
| Inflation Hedge | Rental rates often rise with inflation | Royalty rates are often adjusted upward |
| Liquidity | Low (slow to sell asset) | High (Tradable shares on our exchange) |

**Key Takeaway:** Music consumption remains stable even during economic downturns, making royalties an asset class with low correlation to traditional stock markets, functioning as a reliable, passive income generator with added liquidity.

## Business Model: Triple Revenue Funnel

Kohrus operates on a sustainable, diversified revenue model:

### 1. Issuance Fee
- **5% of capital raised** during Initial Song Offerings (ISOs)
- One-time fee paid by artists when they successfully raise capital
- Validates the primary market demand

### 2. Royalty Management Fee
- **5% of gross royalties** collected
- Ongoing fee for managing royalty collection, distribution, and shareholder payouts
- Ensures sustainable operations as the platform scales

### 3. Secondary Transaction Fees
- **1.5% per trade** on the secondary market
- Split between buyer and seller (or absorbed by one party)
- Rewards platform liquidity and trading activity

This triple revenue funnel ensures profitability is not reliant on a single stream, providing financial stability and scalability.

### 3. Liquidity Emphasis
Strong focus on secondary market functionality to provide genuine trading opportunities, making the asset attractive for both long-term holders and traders.

### 4. Financial Innovation
First platform to truly democratize music IP investment, making it accessible to retail investors with low minimums (₹50 entry point) while maintaining institutional-grade compliance.

## Market Validation & Returns
